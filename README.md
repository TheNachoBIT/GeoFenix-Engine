# GeoFenix Engine

GeoFenix is a game engine which goal is to extend Geometry Dash and RetroFunk's Limits and make everything much faster.
This engine contains 2D objects located in a 3D space at the moment, and it's capable to contain a lot of them in the camera with really good results!

At the moment, as an example you can load Online Levels from Geometry Dash using GDBrowser's API (https://gdbrowser.com & https://gdbrowser.com/api/) so you can load and render entire levels from small ones to really big ones (100k to +300k objects).

# I wanna play this test in an executable file, where is the download link?

Here: https://github.com/TheNachoBIT/GeoFenix-Engine/releases

# I wanna run this project, how can i do it?

Well, first of all, you're gonna need to install "Visual Studio 2019" with the "Desktop Environment for C++" package (make sure in the installer to mark "Windows 10 SDK", probably located on the right in the Visual Studio Installer, otherwise is not going to run).

Once you have everything installed, proceed to open up the ".sln" project with that application and you're done!

# I wanna do some experiments with this but i don't have any knowledge about how engines work internally, what do i do?

Just go to the "Game.cpp" file, that file is to run stuff easily without having to deal with the "main.cpp" script.
In the game script there's a little example with comments that'll get you started with instantiating objects and how stuff works.

There's an API documentation in the works but if you wanna go further and investigate what you can do under the "game" file, you're gonna have to do it by yourself.

# I'm a programmer and i'm interested in this project, how can i contribute?

If you wanna help and improve this engine, just send me a direct message via Twitter (https://twitter.com/TheNachoBIT) or via Discord (NachoBIT#9845). Both have DMs open so don't need to follow me or send a friend request in order to message me :D

# Is there more stuff that needs to be done/added in this?

Yes, A LOT, for example:
- Better optimization.
- Multithreading.
- Audio.
- UI (User Interfaces).
- More tools for coding.
- Cross-platforming (Mac and Linux support).

# There's an issue, problem, bug, suggestion or an idea about this.
